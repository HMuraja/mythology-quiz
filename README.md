# Testing

## HTML Validator
The Official W3C validator for HTML was ran twice. On the initial run, 4 misuses of Aria-labels where flagged. Aria-labels were removed or replaced more appropriate attribute. On the second run no errors occurred.

## CSS Validator
The Official Jigsaw validator for CSS validator was ran twice. First run came up with one error which was related to incorrect value. Error was corrected and no further errors were detected the second time around. There were few warnings about use of external vendors used to  control the background image. 



## JS Validator
The official Jshint validator for JS was ran twice for the script.js. First time round there was no errors, but warnings and unrecognized variables were noted. Most of the warnings were related to use of "let" and "const" keywords with version ES6. Similar warnings were flagged around the use of template literals. These might cause an issue if older browser types are used.

From the undeclared variables 2 cases were corrected, just by adding a simple declaration. Few variables were unrecognized as they originated from another js file, a comment was added for clarification. 
A semicolon was noted to be missing from one line, and another line had excess one, both were corrected. 
A for loop was missing a variable declaration. Declaration added to the loop.

The scrip.js was ran through the validator for the second time after changes and no new warnings were noted. 

Following metrics were returned:
  * There are 15 functions in this file
  * Function with the largest signature take 1 argument, while the median is 0.
  * Largest function has 23 statements in it, while the median is 5.
  * The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 6 while the median is 1.

When question.js was ran through the validator, no errors or significant warnings were noted. No metrics were provided for this file.
